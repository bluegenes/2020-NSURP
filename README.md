# DIB Lab NSURP Research Project

Welcome to the project home for our NSURP research materials! The [training website](https://dib-lab.github.io/2020-NSURP/) contains a much prettier (rendered) version of these materials - check it out!

This project is designed to facilitate learning bioinformatic techniques while working through a metagenomics project on publicly-available data.

During this project, you will learn how to:

  + keep a detailed lab notebook
  + interact with an HPC (we'll use [Farm](https://www.hpc.ucdavis.edu/posts/about_farm/))
  + install and manage software environments using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
  + download sequencing data and other files from the internet and public databases
  + interpret and use different file formats in bioinformatics and computing
  + conduct quality analysis and control for sequencing data
  + determine the taxonomic composition of sequencing reads
  + quickly compare large sequencing datasets
  + build reproducible workflows using snakemake
  + document workflows using git and GitHub
  + troubleshoot errors during your analysis
 
The material in this repository was primarily written or aggregated by @bluegenes, @taylorreiter, and @hehouts.
