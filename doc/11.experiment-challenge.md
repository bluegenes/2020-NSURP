Experiment Challenge
===

Thus far, we've run through a set of commands with six metagenome samples. 
These have been from two patients, one with Crohn's disease, one without.
But there's not much we can say with just two patients (other than "they look different!").

Now, we'll add samples from more patients and try to understand the differences between samples.

## Trim and compute sourmash signatures for these files

Using your HackMD notes, run the commands for trimming (both adapter and k-mer trimming) on these samples.

For reference, the [Quality Control](07.quality-control) contains code for running `fastp` and `khmer` trimming; the [Comparing Samples with Sourmash](09.comparing-samples-with-sourmash) contains code for computing sourmash signatures.


## Run Sourmash Compare

Run `sourmash compare` and `sourmash plot` (as in [Comparing Samples with Sourmash](09.comparing-samples-with-sourmash)).

What do you notice about the sourmash comparison heatmap?

Which samples are more similar to each other? 
Can you guess which patients have Crohn's disease or no IBD by comparing them to your prior samples?
How do samples from the same patient compare to samples from different patients?


## Assess Taxonomic Diversity

Run `sourmash gather` with the `genbank-k31` database on these new samples. 

Count the total number of species found in each sample. Does it differ between Crohn's disease and non-IBD patients?
